Description: Provides comprehensive tools for fitting parametric survival models 
    (exponential, Weibull, lognormal, log-logistic, Gompertz, generalized gamma, 
    and gamma distributions) to survival data. Features include automated model 
    fitting with various configurations (dependent, independent, or both), 
    Kaplan-Meier curve visualization with parametric overlays, hazard function 
    estimation and plotting, proportional hazards assumption testing through 
    Schoenfeld residuals and statistical tests, Q-Q plots for distribution 
    assessment, and automated generation of comprehensive survival analysis reports. 
    Supports multiple data formats including CSV, Excel, and SAS datasets.
