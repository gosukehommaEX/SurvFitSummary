\title{Generate Dummy Survival Data}
\usage{
generate_dummy_survival_data(arm, n, hazards, dropout_per_year, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{arm}{Character vector specifying treatment arm names.
Example: c("Treatment A", "Treatment B", "Control")}

\item{n}{Integer vector specifying number of subjects per arm.
Length must match length of \code{arm}. Example: c(50, 100, 150)}

\item{hazards}{Numeric vector specifying hazard rates for each ARM.
Length must match length of \code{arm}. Higher hazard = shorter survival.
Example: log(2) / c(18, 15, 10) for median survival times of 18, 15, 10 months}

\item{dropout_per_year}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying annual dropout rate.
Example: 0.1 means 10 percent dropout per year}

\item{seed}{Integer specifying random seed for reproducibility.
Use the same seed to generate identical datasets across runs}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) containing the following columns:
\describe{
\item{SUBJID}{Subject identifier (character)}
\item{ARM}{Treatment arm (factor)}
\item{SURVTIME}{Observed survival time in months (numeric)}
\item{CNSR}{Censoring indicator: 1 = censored, 0 = event (numeric)}
}
}
\description{
This function generates simulated time-to-event data with treatment arms.
It is useful for testing survival analysis workflows and parametric survival
modeling functions.
}
\details{
The function generates survival times from exponential distributions with
specified hazard rates for each treatment arm. Dropout times are also
generated exponentially based on the annual dropout rate. The observed
survival time is the minimum of event time and dropout time.

# Example 1: Two-arm trial
data1 <- generate_dummy_survival_data(
  arm = c("Treatment", "Control"),

# Example 2: Three-arm trial

# Example 3: Single arm study
data3 <- generate_dummy_survival_data(
